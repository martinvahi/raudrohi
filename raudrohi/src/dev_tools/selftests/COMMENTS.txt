============  Raudrohi JavaScript Library (RJSL) Selftests ================
===========================================================================

WARNING (October 2012): The selftests system is currently out of order. 

TODO: update the Rakefile so that it generates a proper HTML-file that
runs the selftests.

The text below the line after the next line is probably rubbish.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run selftests, one has to have the whole development environment
in place. That includes the availability of Sirel PHP library (SPHPL), 
Kibuvits Ruby Library (KRL) , Renessaator tool, etc.

After installing the SPHPL, KRL, etc., setting all of the 
the environment variables (SIREL_HOME, RUBY_HOME, GEM_HOME,
KIBUVITS_HOME, RAUDROHI_HOME, etc.) one has to run the 
Renessaator on the ../etc/raudrohi_development_configuration.php on the 
server machine to update environment related information within it.

The selftests are run by opening the ./run_selftests.php (in a web browser, 
served by a web server). As tests really run on the web browser
that is used for viewing the ./run_selftests.php , the web browser
has to be "recent enough".

The current version of the selftests suite runs, but in practice
contains 2 considerable bugs:

1) For some unknown reason that probably has something to do
   with web server side configuration the code within the 
   run_selftests.php is not able to trigger of raudrohi-all-in-one 
   file recompilation. A dirty semi-workaround is to run 
   ----verbatim--start----
   ../raudrohi_all_in_one_assembler.bash assemble_for_raudrohi_selftests
   ----verbatim--end------
   from console prior to reloading the ./run_selftests.php

2) Probably due to the very same issues that caused point 1, 
   the ./run_selftests.php is not able to properly execute
   commands chmod and chown, which means that the temporary files
   within the ../tmp_ that are created by the ./run_selftests.php
   can be deleted almost only by root user.

The good news is that unless CSS or embedded fonts are changed, there 
is no need to empty the browser cache before running the ./run_selftests.php, 
because it uses a new file name for the raudrohi-all-in-one 
JavaScript file at every run.


TODO: A lot of the selftests reside in the release code and is
a useless ballast at the final release JavaScript file. One should
refactor the selftests out of the release files to separate
files in this folder here.
